🌸 Iris Classification using Machine Learning

 📌 Overview

This project uses the classic **Iris dataset** to build a machine learning model that classifies iris flowers into three species:

* Setosa
* Versicolor
* Virginica

The classification is based on four measurements:

* Sepal Length
* Sepal Width
* Petal Length
* Petal Width

The goal is to understand basic machine learning classification concepts using **Scikit-learn**.

 🚀 Project Workflow

1️⃣ Load the Dataset

* Used Scikit-learn’s built-in Iris dataset.
* Extracted features and labels for training.

2️⃣ Train-Test Split

* Split the data into **training (70%)** and **test (30%)** sets.

3️⃣ Model Training

* Trained a **Logistic Regression** classifier

4️⃣ Model Evaluation

* Evaluated using:

  * Accuracy score
  * Classification report
  * Confusion matrix

 📊 Results

* Accuracy: 100%
* Perfect precision, recall, and F1-score for all three species.
* Confusion matrix indicated **zero misclassifications**.
